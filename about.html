            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a self-taught full stack developer. I have always been enthusiastic about technology and how it will progress in my lifetime.
                I am always learning whats being discovered, but I have always wanted to create something myself. 
                That's how I found my passion for programming, it allows me to create what I desire and allows me to create apps for other people.
                <br><br>
                Being a developer is not the only thing about me however! My hobbies include video games, reading and watching stories (books, anime, etc), art, and learning.
                My favorite genre for games are platformers with an emphasis on movement. Whether its Hollow Knight, Celeste, or Teeworlds &mdash; they are all my favorites! 
                I love stories as they allow me to experience another world and be immersed. I do tend to favor more fantasy stories rather than stuff relating to real life for that very reason.
                For this reason, I mostly watch anime or read manga. Which made me start appreciating art, which I am currently learning as a hobby! Lastly, I am always willing and very much want to learn.
                I always want to be learning something new whether it's art or programming. It gives me goals that I can appreciate and complete.
